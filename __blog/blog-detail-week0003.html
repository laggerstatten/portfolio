<p>I still don't have Front Matter set up for editing the blog posts. I spent some more time looking at it, and realized that I still need a static-site generator in my stack for blogging. I don't really understand what that is, so that will be on my reading list for this week.</p>

<p>My Digital Publishing work starting this week is to create a poster for an upcoming event. This is outside my typical workflow, as I am not primarily a designer and do not seek work outside of my normal in-house work. I consider myself more of an analyst/developer who incorporates design work into my craft.</p>

<p>The last time I did any pure design work (outside of class) was laying out a picture book for my friend who is an author/illustrator. While switching publishers for a second edition, she used Fiverr to have someone re-master the book. I don't think the original master images were provided to the Fiverr contractor, but regardless, the Fiverr contractor did a pretty terrible job. They just dragged the images into InDesign without regard for how page counts would work, where margins were, or how facing pages would interact. </p>

<p>I need to get onto one of the platforms and find a potential client. </p>
