challenge: |
    <p>In 2018 I read an <a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/12/11/18133776/heb-texas-origin-cult-following">article in Eater</a> about how H-E-B shapes and reflects Texas identity.
        The article noted that H-E-B does a good job with Latinx foods, but not with Vietnamese/Chinese foods.     This article had been bugging me for over 3 years now, and with 2021's focus on AAPI representation,
        I decided to mock up an H-E-B Vietnamese own-brand. </p>

solution: |
    <p>I went to H-E-B Plus and took photos of the packaging of all the Mi Tienda own brand items, and then deconstructed their elements to understand where English vs Spanish is used,     where the logo appears, what legally required elements are on the package, and what marketing happy-talk is on there.     I then went to the Vietnamese market down the street and looked for items that would be good candidates for 1) making a package for this assignment, and 2) sales at H-E-B under an own brand. </p> <p>This project was a re-skin of the Mi Tienda packaging, but with Vietnamese elements instead of Mexican elements. I incorporated Vietnamese patterns/motifs, Vietnamese "feel" typefaces, and photos/illustrations of food. </p>
