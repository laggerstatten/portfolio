challenge: |
    <p>My goal was to produce a magazine that I would like to read. I grew up looking at National Geographic, so I knew that maps had to feature prominently.
        My magazine needed to be sophisticated and delightful. By sophisticated, it needed to cater to an educated audience who could appreciate detailed travel information.
        By delightful, each page of the magazine needed to be pleasing at multiple scales. It needed to be attractive at a glance. As readers continued to look at each page, they
        needed to be pleased with more and more details that unfolded with increased exposure.</p>

solution: |
    <p>I paid special attention to consistency of typefaces and symbols throughout the magazine. User-friendly "Maki" symbols orient readers to essential information.
        The table of contents sorts stories heirarchically by ecoregion or megalopolis. The back cover shows all featured destinations in relation to major cities
        and travel routes. </p>
