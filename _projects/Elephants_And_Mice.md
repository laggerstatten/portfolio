challenge: |
    <p>I wanted to make an immersive storybook that made use of animation and sound. I wanted to use fonts, colors, symbols, and sounds that evoked India.</p>

solution: |
    <p>I animated a movie clip for each section of the story, selected sound effects, and used an online digital voice-over generator.</p> <p>I animated the movie clips and buttons using a mix of motion and classic tweens. I matched the sound effects and narration to the timeline in the movie clips. The fireworks were produced by following an online tutorial. I scripted the events including stops, event listeners, and navigation. </p>
