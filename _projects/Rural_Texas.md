description: A 12-month wall calendar featuring scenes of rural Texas.
course: Digital Imaging I
semester: Fall 2020
focus: Wall calendar

overview: |
    <p class="lead">This was the final project for my Photoshop class. Each photo in the calendar was edited for appearance. The calendar was layed out in InDesign.</p> <p class="lead">Key elements of this project are the seasonal color palette, the moon phase icons, and the small filler images. </p>

challenge: |
    <p>I wanted my calendar to be nature-centric without too many references to societal constructs (other than the months and weeks themselves). I chose to mark changing of the seasons (solstices and equinoxes) and moon phases (new moon and full moon) but not any holidays. I drew inspiration from the French Republican Calendar which attempted to remove influences of the monarchy and Catholic Church from the calendar during the French Revolution. </p>

solution: |
    <p>I used a cell style to differentiate cells in the month header, from days in different seasons, from the "blank" days at the beginning and end of the month.
        I placed raw images into frames to get a feel for how they would fit on the page. Once I was happy that the images worked, I edited each one with Photoshop.
        I applied appropriate image effects, including color balance, brightness contrast, or hue/saturation, to each image.
        I tried to apply effects that would accentuate the featured agricultural product.
        Then, within InDesign, I placed the PSD file in the original frame. </p>

    <p>I used the Farmhand typeface family for wording in order to keep with the rural theme of the calendar. For the days of the month, I used SimSun-ExtB. For months that did not extend all the way to the bottom of the page, I inserted a small photo to fill some of the negative space. I deliberately deviated from the 8.5 x 13" page size for the cover after looking at some calendars available for sale. I went with the half-size page, as would be found in a folding wall calendar. This allowed me to place a single landscape-oriented photo in the center of the cover page. In a more developed project, I would likely add some subdued vector art to the black and brown margins. </p>
