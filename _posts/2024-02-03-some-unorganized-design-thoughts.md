<p>I’m hosting this blog as part of my design portfolio. This is a limited series that I’m only doing as a requirement for my Digital Publishing course. </p>

<p>While revisiting my portfolio, I am finding things that I need to update since the fall of 2022. During 2023, I took a 2-D design course, a basic animation course, a Photoshop for photographers course, and an intro to game design course. All of these have projects that will be represented somewhere on my portfolio. </p>

<p>I spent this morning digging out the blog and blog detail HTML elements to add to my website. I don’t have a content management system, so I will be manually adding copy and photos in VS Code whenever I make a blog post. </p>

<p>This year I decided to get a few analog products as part of a limited digital detox. I’m making more of an effort to visit NPS units this year, so I bought Eastern National’s National Park Passport book. I also haven’t had a regular tabletop gaming group in years, so I bought an adventure-a-day calendar. </p>

<p>A few months ago, while working on my intro to game design course, I discovered the One Page Dungeon contest and fell in love with many of the designs. </p>

<p>I am a bit concerned about my Digital Publishing II course. I was expecting a follow-on to my Digital Publishing I course with a focus on InDesign and print publishing. The curriculum looks like it might be more focused on the "Digital" part of "Digital Publishing" than the "Publishing" part, and is similar to material I already covered in my interactive media classes. </p>
