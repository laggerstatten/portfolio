<p>This week, my group continued work on our animation project. As I've mentioned before, I'm a non-traditional student who is taking classes part-time while employed in professional work. When working on projects in the professional world, I've always been very concerned with the things surrounding the project itself -- governance, how do we make decisions about the project, how and where will we store files, who can sign off on the project being complete, etc etc. In the college-level project, none of this is a concern, and we get right to work on the project. Which I'm sure is easier, but might also be a missed opportunity to introduce college students to how project management works.</p>

<p>Across the courses I've taken at Lone Star, both in Visual Communication and in Computer Programming, I've also noticed that there isn't much discussion about 1) file management, or versioning, or how to use GitHub, and 2) project management tools like Jira. I think this is also a missed opportunity, because most graduates will be in environments where they will be working collaboratively and be expected to understand how to work on a team</p>
