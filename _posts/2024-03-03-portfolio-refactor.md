<p>This week, I finally spent some time wrapping my head around converting this site to use Jekyll as a static site generator. I started by branching the repository so that I could work without altering the currently published site. I then went through and identified the different layouts present in my site, and reduced each to its common code. I then created files for each of my projects with the front matter for each one. I need to go through and clean up the schema, because there is redundancy in some of the front matter fields. But for right now it's a great start and much easier to maintain than what I previously had. I also need to go through and flesh out the pages for the projects I added. </p>

<p>I still have not configured the Front Matter extension to manage the front matter for each of my projects. That's probably on my list for this coming week.</p>

<p>I have not done any design work for the poster graphic assignment. I have enough outstanding design commitments that I can't justify taking on more outside work. I did decide to start working on some of this outstanding work. I worked on a small video editing project in Premier Pro and should have that completed in the coming week, once a couple more files are delivered. I also spent some time reviewing an ecommerce site I had been asked to provide feedback for. </p>
