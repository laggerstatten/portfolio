<p>Over the last week, I went through my projects from the last year and identified some items to add to my portfolio. I have a few studio art projects, a mixed-media/photography/Photoshop project, and a few digital projects. </p>

<p>I found the best photos of these projects, as well as some contemporaneous notes about my design process. I may need to re-photograph some of these projects, as they do not have the most flattering backgrounds. </p>

<p>In my 2-D Design course, I had a few projects which all took a lot of effort. These include a series of 4 pieces with different media and substrates, two mixed-media collages making heavy use of stacked paper, a "viewmaster" comic strip, and a set of acrylic gauche botanical drawings. </p>

<p>For my Photoshop for photographers course, the final project was a mixed-media composition of the names of the months. I cast the names of the French Republican Calendar months in colored resin and then photographed these using a gantry I built. I then Photoshopped these onto patterned backgrounds and made color corrections. </p>

<p>Between my animation course and my game design course I have a few small multimedia projects to add to my portfolio. These are a GIF, a SWF, and a playable game. I need to find a way to put the latter 2 on a website. </p>
