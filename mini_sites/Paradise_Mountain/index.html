					<h2>About Our Resort</h2>
				<div class="col-1-1">
					<article>
						<p>Located just outside of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, Paradise
						Mountain Family Resort is the perfect getaway place for the whole family. Adults
						can enjoy discounted golf and complimentary use of our health club and tennis
						facilities while the little ones participate in our popular childrenâ€™s program.</p>

						<p>Friday night dances are always a hit with the teens, and our new skate park offers
						one of the finest courses designed to entertain and challenge skaters, whether they
						are beginners or more experienced.</p>

						<p>Hiking is a must-do activity in the beautiful Rocky Mountains. Guests can
						participate in one of our wilderness treks (designed for both experienced and
						beginning hikers), or strike out on their own for a more intimate wilderness
						experience.</p>

						<p>In addition to hiking activities, during the summer months guests can enjoy
						horseback riding, white-water rafting, or fly fishing for trout in one of our many
						private streams. Rodeo fans arriving in mid-July will be sure to catch some of the
						events at the annual PRCA Rooftop Rodeo at the nearby Stanley Park Fairgrounds.</p>

						<p>Wintertime guests are sure to enjoy a snowshoe trek along our well-manicured
						trails, a brisk downhill ski run, or the comfort of a cozy fire in our rustic ski lodge.</p>

						<p>Other on-site or nearby seasonal events and activities include Boulder Walk and
						Bike Week (June), 4th of July Fireworks, The Paradise Mountain Cycling Road
						Rally (July), and the Scottish Highlands Festival (the week following Labor Day).</p>
