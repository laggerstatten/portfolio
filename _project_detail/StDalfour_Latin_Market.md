description: Four labels for Latin jelly flavors.
course: Design Communications II
semester: Fall 2021
focus: Product package

overview: |
    <p class="lead">This was a mid-semester project focused on moving a brand, using changes to layout, type, and color.</p> <p class="lead">I picked a brand of jelly found at Whole Foods, assessed its positioning,     and took photos of its placement and surrounding shelves.     I intentionally moved the brand toward the utility pole in order to reach a broader audience.     I invented 4 new flavors. I made several sketches and decided on one, and executed it in Illustrator.     I then took a finished label and mocked it up in Photoshop. </p>

challenge: |
    <p>I started this project by checking out the shelves at HEB, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. I decided that jelly would be a good choice, since most jellies are based on fruit,
        and it's easy to get digital assets of fruit to use in a project like this. I found an upscale brand at Whole Foods and decided I could do a position shift away from luxury branding on this. </p>
    <p>I decided to make it a bit more simple, and needed to come up with a backstory for my one page write up. I've been drinking a lot of Jarritos sodas and eating a lot of paletas lately,
        so I decided that the brand (St Dalfour) could have gotten into the "Representation Matters" messaging. In this scenario, this upscale brand has decided to 1) expand into Latinx flavors,     and 2) market these to a broader customer base to introduce them to these Latinx flavors. Because Representation Matters. Even in jelly.</p>

solution: |
    <p>I made a master list of flavors I'd be interested in making labels of (sandia, tamarind, guava, jamaica, pineapple, lime, mango)
        and got onto Envato Elements to find at least four that I could get digital assets for.
        I found vector drawings and vector backgrounds of tamarind, guava, jamaica, and quince so decided that these would be my four new flavors. </p>
    <p>I created a label design based on the original upscale St Dalfour design, and made it a bit less fancy.
        I straightened out curved elements, changed the font to one with fewer ligatures,
        and de-emphasized the "made in France" text. </p>
    <p>For the product mockup, I bought a jar of jelly, took some photos, ate all the jelly in one day, and took some more photos of the empty jar against a white backdrop.
        I imported into Photoshop and started warping the label onto the jar. I went to get some pictures of chamoy, because I figure that the color that tamarind jelly would be.
        I made the jar semi-transparent, and put a chamoy-colored rectangle underneath it, so that it will look like the jar is full of tamarind jelly. </p>
