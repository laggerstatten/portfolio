overview: |
  <p class="lead">This project originated in Design Communications I and 3 years later was refined for Design Communications II.
  Layout, typefaces, and the general tone of the composition all changed.</p>

challenge: |
  <p>I refined the idea for an appropriate book, decided on a title, author, and dimensions, and began committing these to a design in InDesign.
  I want to make a coffee table book (an atlas) which is a landscape-oriented book that would be full of similarly oriented maps.</p>
  
solution: |
  <p>I chose to make the background image a map of the Earth, because I wanted something with a variety of colors that weren't too overwhelming and that was obviously thematically linked to the book.
  Even though this is a modern book, the subject matter spans 1949 - 1989, so I wanted to make use of typefaces from that timespan to avoid thematic clash.
  I want the book jacket to be modern, but also a bit retro to the period.
  I put the main title "Global Conflagration" in Avant Garde Gothic Bold with a 15deg skew (true italics were not available).
  The subtitle "A Thematic Atlas of the Cold War Era" is in Baskerville.
  I once again used Avant Garde Gothic Bold (but in black with no skew) for the author's name.
  I ensured that there was a size hierarchy between the title, subtitle, and author.
  Based on feedback I received, I reduced the size of the map background and inserted a neutral gradient towards the top of the page.
  This provides a background with better contrast for the title.
  I also changed the title from having a solid red fill to having a photo fill (of fire).</p>
  <p>On the inside flaps, I used Futura for the body text. This lends itself to easy reading of the book summary and about the author sections.
  I used visual hierarchy and appropriate justifications and spacing to ensure that the reader could easily read the marketing information inside the flaps.
  On the back page, I added short quotes pulled from reviews.
  I kept these in a simple neutral color and made use of bolding and justification to separate quotes from sources.</p>
