overview: |
    <p class="lead">This was the final project for my Illustrator class. Each bill consists of many layers, images, and text elements.</p>

challenge: |
    <p>For my overall theme, I wanted to highlight the industries that form the basis of our economy and way of life. I went with three industries in the primary sector: agriculture, mining, and utilites. Without these, no other industry would be possible, and we would not have food, raw materials, or energy.
        I chose not have any people on my bills, but these are still representative of all the people's whose labor makes modern life possible.</p>

solution: |
    <p>I wanted the front of the bill to feature a hero photo and a background. In order to make some space between them, I put the hero photo in grayscale. I know some people might have done the opposite,
        but I wanted to keep the large color banner on the background. Making the hero photo was a convoluted process. I embedded the photo, and made two copies.
        For the top copy, I did an image trace in B&W, and for the bottom copy I did an image trace in grayscale. I then converted the B&W trace to a clipping mask, using ignore white.
        I then framed the hero photo using a semi-transparent black oval and an opaque black frame (using pathfinder). For the background photo, I used the cutout filter to reduce it to a few colors.</p>
    <p>I wanted to retain many of the features found on normal currency, so I copied these from a pre-Great Depression 20 dollar bill. I also decided to go with some of the typefaces used during the WPA projects.
        I could not find these exact typefaces (they were silkscreens and letterpress), so I found similar fonts: Great Lakes, Stadium, Verlag. I considered using color for the text, but decided that black typeface looked better than any alternative.
        I tried to go for a gold effect in some places, to imitate gold embossed type on some currency.</p>
    <p>For the back of the bill, I decided against using a picture, as I think some patterns and type look good on their own. I found a curved pattern, a paper texture, and some agriculture and mining icons.
        I pasted a different pattern on each bill back and edited the color gradient (green for ag, black for mining, and blue for utilites). I made it semi-transparent as well.
        I placed a few icons on the bill (corn for ag, pick for mining, and windmill for utility) and turned the transparency way up, for a watermark effect.
        At the very base of the bill back, I placed a paper texture image and made a clipping mask to the bill dimensions. This shows through the semi-transparent background.
        For the gilded text, I expanded the text, made the resulting paths into a compound path, and used it to clipping mask a gold foil image.</p>
    <p>I don't like the repeating texture of the gold foil on the lettering. I wish it were more organic. I don't like the windfarm background, as I feel it is too simplfied. </p>
