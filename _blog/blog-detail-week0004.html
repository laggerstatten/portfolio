<p>This week, I started listening to the audiobook of Brene Brown's Daring Greatly. I didn't expect for it to have relevance for the design side of my life, but surprisingly it did. If you're not familiar with Brene Brown, she is a social worker who has written extensively about shame and vulnerability. One of the things she wrote about in Daring Greatly is decoupling self-worth from what we produce. This especially applies to design, because I can be more willing to experiment with new things if I don't take criticism of my work as a criticism of me. The other place where Daring Greatly rouches on design, is the discussion of organizational culture and how to create a culture where people can be shame-resilient. </p>

<p>I'm also working on figuring out how to move this portfolio site over to using a static site generator. I spent some time looking at SSGs and it looks like Jekyll is an option with a lot of support and is widely adopted. I need to find some time to experiment with that. I built this portfolio a couple of years ago based on a Bootstrap template I bought. I manually edit the HTML and CSS whenever I need to add a page or make changes.</p>
